# HTML CSS JS Basics Project

A simple html responsive page demostrating the bank's operations using javascript. 
1. In the home page you can access an existing account or create one;
2. In the operations page you can deposit, withdraw or transfer values;
3. In the balance page you'll have the statement with all the operations in a table. 

It was used OOP to handle the accounts and the creation of a json file to transfer the information between pages.
